              <h2>Our Online Programs & Certificates - 2022</h2>
              <p>Online certifications are slightly different than the typical online classes. They don’t require any prerequisites and allow participants to earn qualifications in a particular field, or area of expertise, without spending the same amount of time, and money, it takes to achieve a traditional degree.</p>
              <br>
              <p>A decent amount of the certifications offered are considered asynchronous, meaning that the classes aren’t happening at a set time every week, and students can access pre-recorded lectures and course materials at their own pace. Whether your pockets of free time exist before work, during your lunch breaks, after work, or on the weekends, asynchronous classes allow you to have access 24 hours a day, 7 days a week so you can knock out your lectures and coursework whenever is most convenient.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Whether you want to learn a new language, improve your management skills, develop a strength in graphic design, or become proficient in statistics and accounting, there are resources out there to help you develop your craft. Just like any other professional, I’m always looking for ways to finetune my skillset. The key to my success is completing an online certification specifically tailored toward my areas of improvement, whether that be public speaking, leadership, or something else, to make the most out of my free time.</p>
              <br>
              <P>Depending on your field of interest, there may be popular certifications that can go a long way. For example, the Project Management Professional (PMP) Certification, the Certified Business Analysis Professional (CBAP) Certification, the Lean Six Sigma Certification, and the Society of Human Resource Management Certified Professional (SHRM-CP) certification, can hold a substantial amount of value on your résumé in the corporate world, especially as companies are looking to fill open positions with professionals who have received industry-oriented training.</P>
              <br>
              <p>Online certifications offer a unique path to help you find success. With a good amount of focus and determination, you can make the most of your career and put yourself on a path to master your own craft, or even become proficient in another.</p>
